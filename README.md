# AdministrationEmailCreator
This Java project focuses on creating email accounts for new hires. It generates an email in the format `firstname.lastname@department.company.com`, assigns a random password, and includes setters for changing the password, mailbox capacity, and alternate email. Getters retrieve the name, email, and mailbox capacity.
